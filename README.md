# KnockLock

- npm run dev to run or knocklock.vercel.app

## Purpose

- Many people have a hard time unlocking doors with a key (the disabled, elderly, children, people with their hands full).
- However, it's MUCH easier to knock on a door to unlock it. If you can move and have any appendages, you can knock on a door.
- KnockLock allows anyone to set a unique knocking pattern and use that to unlock their door.
- AI can even randomly generate a knocking pattern if you want extra security.

## Issues we ran into

- Our AI that generates random knocks did not want to produce sound for the longest time.
- The opened door image kept not being the right size, but it was an issue with the image ratio.
- One of our members had deleted a component while another member was editing it, which created merge issues. We were able to save all the information and integrate them properly.
